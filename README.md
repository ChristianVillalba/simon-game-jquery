# Simon Game : jquery
This project uses **JavaScript** and the **jQuery** library.    
**Objective:** Create a game with sounds and animations.

⚠️ Warning: Sounds    

## How to play:    
· We have 4 tiles (buttons), each one had a color.    
· The tiles will display an animation and sound when activated.    
· Press any key or click the title  to start the game:    
· Simon will give the first signal.    
· Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button.  
· Pressing the right patterns will take us to the next level.     
· A new tile will be activated.        
· On each new level Simon will add a signal and     
we have to repeat all the previous sequence adding the last signal.    
· If you fail to repeat the sequence exactly, the game is over.     
· Press any key or click the title to re-start the game:    

## What I learnt with this Project:    

* Understanding the DOM     
* Connect our html file and our JS file   
* Add the **jQuery CDN** to html file  
* Create functions and variables using JS in order to create the game pattern.  
* Concatenating strings in order to access different elements (even in other folders).   
* Using **jQuery** to **target elements**.     
* Adding **EventListeners** with **jQuery**. 
* Response to Events:    
  * **Higher order functions**    (functions with another function as input).     
  * **Callback Functions**        (the functions passed as input).     
* Adding and removing classes with JS (The HTML element will be displayed with different CSS styles [classes])  
* Responsive design: **mobile first**          
It took me a ridiculous amount of time, however, I am now happy how it is displayed in small screens.  
* This project was deployed online:
    * Using domain names and DNS protocols.
    * Pointing Domain Names to Hosting Services
    * Using Hosting Services
    * Deployment of static websites
    * Using FTP Protocol
