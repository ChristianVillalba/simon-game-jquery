Simon Game:  
This project uses JavaScript and the jQuery library

Game:
-We have 4 tiles (buttons), each one had a color.
-The tiles will display an animation and sound when activated.
-Press any key to start:
-It will show us, through an animation and a sound, a random tile to be pressed.
-We have to follow the pattern. 
-Pressing the right patterns will take us to the next level:
A new tile will be activated.
-Through the levels , the patterns to follow will be more complicated. 
We have to add the last tile to the entire previous sequence.
-Pressing the wrong tile: The game is over. We can press any key to start the game.

Project:
-Connect our html file and our js file
[Check in browser: alert("Hello World")]
-Add the jQuery CDN to html file
[Check in DevTools: $("h1").css("color","red")]
-Create functons and variables using JS in order to create the game pattern.
