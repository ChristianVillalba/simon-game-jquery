This project uses JavaScript and the jQuery library

Game:
-We have 4 tiles (buttons), each one had a color.

-It will show us, through an animation and a sound, a random tile to be pressed.
-We have to follow the pattern.
-Pressing the right patterns will take us to the next level.
-Through the levels , the patterns to follow will be more complicated.
